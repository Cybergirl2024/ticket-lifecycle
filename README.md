The first thing I did was create tickets with the users and help topics I created in the last project. I am going to create two more tickets like this one but different problems and help topics. So when I am done creating all of the tickets I should see them in Janet doe's back office.

<p>
These are all the tickets I created except for the osTicket installed. Next I am going to assign each of these tickets to a specific department, agent and SLA.

The first ticket I modified waws the mobile banking system ticket. I assigned the ticket to the department Support, I assigned the ticket to John Doe and assigned the SLA plan Sev-A. This means that this ticket has to be solved within 24 hours and the grace period is only 1 hour because it is a high priority.

I resolved this ticket for the CFO's tablet and I assigned it to myself System Admin and closed it meaning the issue is resolved.

<p>
The next ticket I am going to resolve is the one assigned to john doe. So I am going to sign in as john doe and check on that ticket.

So with John Doe he does not full access to open or close any tickets because he is not assigned to system administrative but he is only able to reply. This is the last of this project. I just wanted to show how to assign certain tickets to certain departments, resolving certain issues and talk to people with the reply with John Doe
